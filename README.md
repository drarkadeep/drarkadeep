### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Arkadeep means Sunlight. ðŸŒž 
- Sunlight consists of UV-B rays that travel ~8 light minutes to Earth.
- Then they photolyse 7-dehydrocholesterol.
- Which spontaneously rearranges to form cholecalciferol.
- Cholecalciferol travels to Liver.
- It becomes 25-hydroxy cholecalciferol.
- This then travels to Kidney.
- Where it becomes 1,25-hidydroxy cholecalciferol.
- Then it combines with Vitamin D receptor and heterodimerizes along with retinoid X receptor.
- This upregulates genes to achieve calcium and phosphate homeostasis in blood.
- Adequate calcium mineralizes bone with the help from osteoblasts.
- Well mineralized bones make you strong. ðŸ’ª

#### In other words, I make you strong (ðŸŒž = ðŸ’ª)

### You're welcome...
